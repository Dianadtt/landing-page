            <h1>About me</h1>
            <small>Diana Toth</small>
            <p>So, while trying to find the best description of myself, I had this idea that I could write a few words about me in a +/- comparison, or The +, But – self description. So here it is. I am very technical with anything regarding work or professional
                activities, But I also need diversity. Having developed analytical skills during my studies and throughout my career, I consider myself very good with numbers and technical data, I have attention to detail and I enjoy solving problems.
                However, my activities need to constantly change or to adapt so as not to get into a standard work routine; in my case, diversity brings productivity. I am outgoing and a nature lover, But the context needs to be right. I absolutely love
                going on hikes, spending time outdoors, in the mountains preferably, but I enjoy this the most if the group of people that accompany me has the same mindset. This is strictly regarding my spare time, when I need to free my mind from work;
                in a professional environment, I totally understand that people have different approaches, work styles and priorities, and I am quite fond of learning from them, understanding their needs and finding common ground in working out solutions
                for our tasks. As a follow-up for the description above, I’ve proved to myself and others that I have leadership capabilities. So, I am a leader, But I can also follow directions properly. During my activities as an engineer, I used to
                take initiative in many areas of the projects I worked on and most likely this is the reason why I was promoted to lead engineer. I am the person who asks why, why that way and why not this other way that requires a smaller use of our
                resources. This of course involves cooperation and one of my favorite parts is being actively involved in a team because nothing is more satisfying than seeing a group of people with different values and backgrounds that work together
                and succeed in reaching a common goal. I love to jog, But I am also quite lazy sometimes. I mean, who isn’t ? Sometimes I find myself wanting to go out to exercise and I have this internal conflict between my will to work out and my comfortable
                self that prefers watching TV series indoors. I usually end up going for that jog, which speaks to my ability to prioritize and to overcome obstacles in order to reach my goal. </p>
            <h3>Me in Tatra Mountains</h3>

            <p>
                Nobody’s perfect, everyone has their flaws. I think that knowing the + and the – about yourself is absolutely crucial both in your personal and professional life. Sometimes it’s about accepting the -, not correcting it. Or to focus on the +, even if the
                – exists. So this me.
